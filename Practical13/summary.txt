The length of SOD2 is 222 amino acids. 

Its subcellular location is mitochondrion matrix. the matrix is the mitochondrion internal spaces enclosed by the inner membrane.

The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results is from 83.3 to 100.

The results are listed below:
    For human and mouse, the alignment score is 1097.0, the percentage of identical amino acids is 90.09009009009009
    For human and random, the alignment score is -262.0, the percentage of identical amino acids is 3.6036036036036037        
    For random and mouse, the alignment score is -258.0, the percentage of identical amino acids is 4.054054054054054
The SOD2 in human and mouse get the highest alignment score and percentage, so they are most closely related.
